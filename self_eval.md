# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

Being able to slowly go through the process of solving each problem.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

Methods can be defined in many ways and using them in our applications makes it easier to multiply our effects. Once they are defined, they can called upon and executed numerous times instead of writing that code over and over.
